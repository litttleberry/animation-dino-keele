Part of coursework assignment for Computer Animation and Multimedia module at Keele University, spring semester 2022.

## What's it about
A Processing sprite animation of a wee dinosaur trotting along with a jurassic landscape in the background, complete with tunes and rolling credits.

### Goals to meet assessment criteria
- A 2D sprite animation comprising of the following: 
	- a self-made sprite,
	- a self-made scrolling background, 
	- sound, and 
	- rolling credits that document the media, animation and programming of the sketch.
- Header, comments, code format, on-screen labels or user instructions also assessed

### Used technologies
Processing (Java)

### Timeline
Completed in February-March 2022. Did not think to use git at the time, hence only the code of the final product is available.
